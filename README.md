# webpack-unbundle

`webpack-unbundle` is a CLI and library to make reverse-engineering bundled JavaScript applications easy and accessible. It aims to allow the separation, grouping, naming and deobfuscation of production-bundled code.

<!-- TODO
- **Extensive** - separate, isolate, group, name and prune individual modules easily.
- **Robust** - supports Webpack 4, 5 with the majority of configs.
