# TODO

- [ ] Make some full examples - include their webpack versions and configs. Use pnpm workspaces.
- [ ] Use node:test (or vitest?) to test the examples
- [ ] Experiment with code purpose inference for file naming
- [ ] Write a readme with some example usage
- [ ] Add an extension for module isolation. Maybe have different operations for the script - unbundle, filter (uses eval to prune the module graph)
- [ ] Add pretty logging when parsing chunks with loading spinners
- [ ] Add colors for logs?
